                 MULTITHREADING

* DeadLock :- when program is not able to access the class due to some restriction
              it will not be able to end so this situation is known as deadlock situation;

* Occur    :- when there are two or more class with Synchronised methods and they are interdependent
              on each other i,e they are calling each other from inside and we are using Multithreading
              to run our program faster then Deadlock will occur;
              To avoid Multithreading we can make any class  non synchronise.
